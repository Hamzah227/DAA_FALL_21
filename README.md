## PROBLEMS
---
* Dynamic Programming
* Divide And Coquer

## APPROACH
* **Dynamic Programming**

In the first row, the first square adds four new lines, and subsequent squares add three new semi-exhausted lines apiece. The last square in the row exhausts two lines: the row, and one of its diagonals (namely, the short single-element diagonal). So, after the first row there are 3n - 1 semi-exhausted lines. The first square in the second row adds a new row line and a new diagonal line, and exhausts the other (two-element) diagonal, for a net gain of one line. The remaining squares in the second row have no effect until we get to the last square, which adds a new diagonal and exhausts the row line and a short (two-element) diagonal, for a net loss of one line. Subsequent rows behave like the second row. Again, the final row exhausts various lines, but that does not concern us.

* **Divide And Conquer**

In the array, the first square adds four new lines, and subsequent squares add three new semi-exhausted lines apiece. The last square in the row exhausts two lines: the row, and one of its diagonals (namely, the short single-element diagonal). So, after the first row there are 3n - 1 semi-exhausted lines. The first square in the second row adds a new row line and a new diagonal line, and exhausts the other (two-element) diagonal, for a net gain of one line. The remaining squares in the second row have no effect until we get to the last square, which adds a new diagonal and exhausts the row line and a short (two-element) diagonal, for a net loss of one line. Subsequent rows behave like the second row. Again, the final row merges all the lines subsequently.
